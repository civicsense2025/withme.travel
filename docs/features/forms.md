# WithMe Forms

Travel planning involves more than just deciding where to go. It's about bringing friends together, making shared decisions, and creating experiences everyone will love. Our forms feature makes collecting opinions, preferences, and feedback a breezeâ€”no more scrolling through endless group chats to find out who's vegetarian or who wants that sunset sailing trip.

## What Makes Our Forms Special

Unlike typical form builders, WithMe forms are designed specifically for group travel planning. They're conversational, mobile-optimized, and feel like chatting with a friend rather than filling out paperwork. One question at a time keeps focus high and form fatigue low.
