# User Testing and Feedback Collection Plan

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines our comprehensive approach to collecting user feedback across the withme.travel platform. The goal is to systematically gather actionable insights that will drive product improvements, validate assumptions, and ensure we're building features that solve real user problems.

## 2. Feedback Collection Methodology

### 2.1 When to Collect Feedback

We'll employ a multi-tiered approach to feedback collection:

1. **In-app contextual feedback**: Short, focused questions during or immediately after key user journeys
2. **Post-task feedback**: Feedback after completing a significant task (e.g., creating a trip, inviting friends)
3. **Session-level feedback**: Overall satisfaction survey at the end of meaningful sessions
4. **Periodic comprehensive surveys**: Scheduled evaluation of the entire product experience
5. **Exit surveys**: When users downgrade, cancel, or show signs of churning

### 2.2 Types of Feedback to Collect

- **Usability feedback**: How easy or difficult was a specific interaction
- **Feature value feedback**: How useful users find specific features
- **Satisfaction metrics**: NPS, CSAT, and other standardized metrics
- **Feature requests**: What users want to see added or improved
- **Pain points**: Areas of frustration or confusion
- **Comparative feedback**: How our solution compares to alternatives
- **Behavioral data**: Usage patterns supplementing explicit feedback
