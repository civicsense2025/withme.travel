## 🚦 How Group Planning Flows Into Trips

### Visual Hierarchy

```
Group
 └─ Plan (Idea Board / Whiteboard)
     └─ [Voting, Brainstorming, Polls]
         └─ "Create Trip" Action
             └─ Trip
                 └─ Trip Cities (multi-city, ordered)
                     └─ Itinerary Sections (per city)
                         └─ Itinerary Items
```

- **Groups**: Collaborative spaces for friends to brainstorm, vote, and plan.
- **Plans**: Each group can have multiple whiteboards/idea boards (plans) for different trip ideas.
- **Trip Creation**: Once consensus is reached, a plan can be turned into a trip with one click. The trip is auto-populated with selected destinations, dates, and group members.
- **Trips**: Support multiple cities (multi-city), with each city having its own dates and itinerary sections.

## 🌍 Multi-City Trip Model

- **Trips**: Now support multiple cities via a `trip_cities` join table (not just a single `destination_id`).
- **trip_cities**: Each row links a trip to a city, with:
  - `position` (order in trip)
  - `arrival_date` / `departure_date` (per-city dates)
- **Itinerary Sections**: Each section is attached to a specific `trip_city_id`, so you can organize plans by city.
- **Itinerary Items**: Belong to an itinerary section, which is scoped to a city.

**Example:**
- Trip: "Europe 2024"
  - Paris (July 1–4)
    - Day 1: Paris Museums
    - Day 2: Montmartre
  - Rome (July 4–7)
    - Day 4: Colosseum
    - Day 5: Vatican

## 👫 Group & Plan Integration

- **Groups**: Users start by creating a group and inviting friends.
- **Plans (Whiteboards)**: Each group can have multiple plans (idea boards) for different trip ideas.
- **Voting & Polls**: Members brainstorm, vote, and run polls to decide on destinations, dates, and budgets.
- **Trip Creation**: When ready, a plan can be converted into a trip. The trip creation form is pre-filled with the chosen cities, dates, and group members.
- **Group-Trip Link**: The group remains linked to the trip for ongoing discussion and coordination.

## 📈 Visual Flow: From Group to Trip

```
[Group] 
   └─ [Plan/Whiteboard] 
         └─ [Voting, Polls, Brainstorming]
               └─ [Create Trip]
                     └─ [Trip]
                           └─ [Trip Cities]
                                 └─ [Itinerary Sections]
                                       └─ [Itinerary Items]
```

- **Every trip can have multiple cities, each with its own dates and itinerary.**
- **Trips are often born from group plans, but can also be created solo.**
- **The system is designed for flexibility, collaboration, and fun.**
