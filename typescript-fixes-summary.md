# TypeScript Error Resolution Summary

## Fixed Issues:

1. Added proper type definitions for TripRole in tab-content files:

   - budget-tab-content.tsx
   - itinerary-tab-content.tsx
   - manage-tab-content.tsx

2. Fixed component integration issues:

   - Created proper wrapper for setItineraryItems
   - Implemented async handlers for edit operations
   - Fixed Profile typing issues

3. Added utility functions:
   - formatError
   - formatDateRange
   - getInitials

## Remaining Issues:

1. Some trip-page-client.tsx type issues still remain to be fixed
2. UI component compatibility issues with Dialog, ImageSearchSelector
3. Path resolution issues visible when checking TypeScript errors

## Next Steps:

1. Create a central types file for commonly used types like TripRole
2. Simplify interface inheritance to avoid compatibility issues
3. Potentially use more generic prop types for UI components
