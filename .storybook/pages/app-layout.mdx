# App Layout Components

This section contains components related to the overall app structure and navigation within the withme.travel platform.

## Categories

- **Navigation**: Navbar, Sidebar, TabBar, etc.
- **Page Containers**: Page layouts, containers, and wrappers
- **User Interface**: UserMenuDropdown, profile sections, etc.
- **App Shell**: Core app structure components
- **Responsive Patterns**: Components that adapt across device sizes

## Usage Guidelines

App layout components should:

1. **Provide consistent navigation**: Help users understand where they are and how to move around
2. **Optimize for context**: Show appropriate controls and information based on user context
3. **Scale appropriately**: Work well across device sizes with appropriate adaptations
4. **Maintain performance**: Keep layout components lightweight and optimized
5. **Support both authenticated and unauthenticated states**: Handle all user states gracefully

## Best Practices

When working with app layout components:

1. Use appropriate semantic HTML elements for accessibility
2. Implement responsive behaviors using our breakpoint system
3. Consider navigation patterns that work well on both mobile and desktop
4. Optimize for speed and minimal layout shifting
5. Test across different viewport sizes and with different content lengths
