# withme.travel Design System & Component Library

Welcome to the withme.travel design system and component library. This Storybook instance provides a comprehensive showcase of our UI components, design patterns, and guidelines for building consistent, accessible, and beautiful user experiences.

## Navigation

Our component library is organized into several main sections:

- **Design System**: Core foundations - colors, typography, spacing, theme
- **Core UI**: Reusable UI components (Button, Input, Card, etc.)
- **Features**: Feature-specific components (TripCard, ItineraryBuilder, etc.)
- **Marketing Components**: Components for marketing/landing pages
- **App Layout**: Navigation, layouts, and containers

## Getting Started

1. Browse components using the sidebar navigation
2. Explore variants and properties using the controls panel
3. View component documentation using the "Docs" tab
