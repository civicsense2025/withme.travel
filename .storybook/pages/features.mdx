## Usage Guidelines

Feature components:

1. **Combine core UI elements**: Most feature components are compositions of core UI components
2. **Focus on specific use cases**: Each component addresses a specific user need
3. **Maintain consistency**: Use the same patterns across similar features
4. **Stay adaptable**: Feature components should work in various contexts and viewports
5. **Optimize for collaboration**: Many feature components involve multi-user interactions

## Implementation

When implementing feature components:

1. Use the established Core UI components as building blocks
2. Document prop interfaces thoroughly
3. Consider all states: loading, error, empty, and populated
4. Handle mobile and desktop layouts appropriately
5. Test with realistic data and edge cases
