# withme.travel Design System

Our design system provides a comprehensive set of guidelines, components, and patterns to create consistent and cohesive user experiences across our platform.

## Foundations

### Colors

Our color system is built around a primary palette with supporting accent colors and semantic colors for feedback and status indication.

- **Primary Colors**: Key brand colors and primary actions
- **Neutral Colors**: Backgrounds, text, and borders
- **Semantic Colors**: Success, warning, error, and info
- **Accent Colors**: Additional colors for emphasis and variety

### Typography

We use a clear typographic hierarchy with consistent styles:

- **Headings**: h1-h6 for content structure and hierarchy
- **Body**: Regular text styles for content and descriptions
- **UI Text**: Smaller text for UI elements, labels, and captions
- **Emphasis**: Styles for highlighting important information

### Spacing

Consistent spacing creates visual rhythm and hierarchy. We use a 4px base unit system.

- **4px (xs)**: Minimal spacing between related elements
- **8px (sm)**: Standard spacing between related elements
- **16px (md)**: Spacing between distinct elements
- **24px (lg)**: Spacing between related groups
- **32px (xl)**: Spacing between sections
- **48px+ (2xl+)**: Larger spacings for major section breaks

### Elevation

Our elevation system creates visual hierarchy through shadows:

- **Level 0**: Flat components (no shadow)
- **Level 1**: Subtle separation from background
- **Level 2**: Interactive elements and cards
- **Level 3**: Floating components like dropdowns
- **Level 4**: Modal dialogs and elevated content

## Core Principles

### 1. Consistency

Apply consistent patterns, spacing, and interactions across the entire platform to create a cohesive experience.

### 2. Accessibility

Design for all users regardless of ability, following WCAG 2.1 AA standards for color contrast, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support.

### 3. Flexibility

Components should be adaptable to different contexts while maintaining their core functionality and appearance.

### 4. Performance

Optimize components for speed and efficiency, considering mobile devices and varying connection speeds.

### 5. Clarity

Prioritize clear communication and intuitive interfaces over decorative elements or visual complexity.

## Using the Design System

### For Designers

- Use our shared Figma library for design work
- Follow established patterns and guidelines
- Contribute improvements through the design review process

### For Developers

- Utilize the component library for consistent implementation
- Reference this documentation for usage guidelines
- Raise issues and contribute improvements through PRs

## Design Tokens

Design tokens are the visual design atoms of the design system - they define the visual properties used across the platform.

### Example Token Usage

```tsx
// Using design tokens in components
<Button 
  backgroundColor="primary.500"
  color="neutral.100"
  padding="spacing.md"
  borderRadius="radii.md"
>
  Primary Action
</Button>
```

## Components

Our component library is organized into logical categories:

- **Core UI**: Basic building blocks like buttons, inputs, and cards
- **Feature Components**: Domain-specific components for trips, groups, etc.
- **Layout Components**: Page structures and containers
- **Patterns**: Common UI patterns and behaviors

Each component is documented with:

- Usage guidelines
- Props and configuration options
- Accessibility considerations
- Code examples

## Contributing

Our design system is continuously evolving. To contribute:

1. Review existing documentation and components
2. Discuss proposed changes with the design team
3. Create a PR with your changes
4. Participate in the review process

See the [Contribution Guidelines](/?path=/docs/contributing--docs) for more details.
