# withme.travel Design System

Our design system is structured using a combination of Atomic Design principles and purpose-specific categories to make it easy to find and use components.

## Organization Structure

### Atoms
These are the smallest, most fundamental building blocks of our UI. They cannot be broken down further without losing their functionality.

- **Inputs & Controls**: Buttons, inputs, checkboxes, switches, vote buttons, etc.
- **Typography**: Text elements, headings, paragraphs
- **Feedback**: Alerts, toasts, notifications
- **Data Display**: Badges, labels, tags, icons
- **Layout**: Container, dividers, spacers
- **Media**: Images, avatars, icons
- **Navigation**: Links, breadcrumbs

### Molecules
Molecules are groups of atoms combined together to form relatively simple UI components with their own properties and functionality.

- **Cards**: Simple content containers
- **Forms**: Input groups, form layouts
- **Dialogs & Modals**: Popovers, confirmations
- **Navigation**: Tabs, pagination
- **Feedback**: Complex notifications, progress indicators
- **Lists**: Lists of items, search results

### Organisms
Organisms are complex UI components composed of molecules and/or atoms that form a distinct section of the interface.

- **Sections**: Page sections, hero sections, feature sections
- **Layouts**: Page layouts, grid systems
- **Features**: Domain-specific components (Trip features, Group features)
- **Collaborative**: Components that enable collaboration
- **Authentication**: Login and signup components
- **Groups**: Group-related components
- **Trips**: Trip planning components
- **Itinerary**: Itinerary management components

### Screens

Complete pages or large sections of pages that show how components come together to create a full user experience.

- **Home**: Homepage layouts and variations
- **Trips**: Trip management pages
- **Groups**: Group collaboration screens
- **Itinerary**: Itinerary planning screens
- **Destinations**: Destination browsing and details
- **Authentication**: Login, signup, and password reset pages
- **User**: User profiles and settings
- **Admin**: Admin management interfaces

### Templates

Reusable layout patterns that can be applied across different screens.

- **Marketing**: Landing page templates, promo sections
- **App Layout**: Common application layouts
- **Landing Pages**: Specific landing page templates
- **Dashboards**: Dashboard layouts and templates

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Start with Atoms**: When building new UI, start by exploring available atoms
2. **Compose Upward**: Combine atoms into molecules, then molecules into organisms
3. **Focus on Reusability**: Create components that can be reused across the application
4. **Keep It Consistent**: Follow design tokens and patterns for consistency
5. **Document Everything**: Add appropriate documentation to all components

## Design Tokens

Our design system is built on a foundation of design tokens for:

- Color
- Typography
- Spacing
- Shadows
- Border Radius
- Z-index

Refer to the Design Tokens section for details on usage.
